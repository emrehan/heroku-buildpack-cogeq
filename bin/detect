# A [buildpack](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) is an
# adapter between the COGEQ application and Heroku's runtime.

# ## Usage
# Compiling an app into a slug is simple:
#
#     $ bin/detect <build-dir> <cache-dir>

BUILD_DIR=$1

# Return COGEQ iff there's COGEQ in README
if grep -iq "COGEQ" $1/README.md; then
  echo COGEQ
  exit 0
fi

exit 1
